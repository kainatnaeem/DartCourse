//What is Dart?

//Google had its first ever release of Flutter 1.0 last December, after having it in beta mode for over 18 months. Dart is the programming language used to code Flutter apps. Dart is another product by Google and released version 2.1, before Flutter, in November. As it is starting out, the Flutter community is not as extensive as ReactNative, Ionic, or Xamarin.

void main() {
  print('I Love my Country');
  
  // print("HelloWorld 20 times");
  // for(int i = 0; i <= 20; i++)
  //  print("HelloWorld ");
}
